# Windscribe Browser Extension with Blacklist function

The official Windscribe Browser Extension only comes with a whitelist/allowlist function that allows any website to bypass the proxy connection once whitelisted. However, quite a few people have been asking for a blacklist function on Discord, Reddit, and someone even opened up an [issue](https://github.com/Windscribe/browser-extension/issues/10) within the official repository.

This fork contains only the files that change 'whitelist' to 'blacklist'.
